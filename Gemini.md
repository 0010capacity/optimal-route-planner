# Gemini CLI Interaction Log

This file logs interactions with the Gemini CLI agent for the `optimal-route-planner` project.

## Project Plan (as understood by Gemini)

The goal is to develop a mobile-friendly web application that optimizes routes for multiple destinations using Naver Maps API.

**Key Features:**
- User input for multiple destinations.
- Automatic optimization of destination order for minimum travel time (TSP approach).
- Visualization of the optimized route on Naver Maps.

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: React
- Mapping/Routing: Naver Maps API (Web Dynamic Map, Geocoding, Directions 5)
- Deployment: Firebase Hosting

**Development Phases:**

1.  **Project Setup & Environment Configuration:**
    *   Naver Cloud Platform API setup (Client ID, Client Secret).
    *   React project creation (`create-react-app`).
    *   GitHub repository integration.
    *   Firebase project setup for hosting.

2.  **Core Logic & Algorithm Design:**
    *   Implement TSP (Traveling Salesperson Problem) approach for route optimization.
    *   Implement a permutation generation function in JavaScript.

3.  **UI Implementation & Naver Maps Integration:**
    *   Install `react-naver-maps` library.
    *   Implement place input and list management using React state.
    *   Integrate Naver Search API for place search (custom implementation as no autocomplete widget).
    *   Display markers and draw polylines on the map using `react-naver-maps` components and Naver Directions 5 API results.

4.  **Feature Integration & Finalization:**
    *   Implement "Optimize Route" button functionality:
        *   Separate start, waypoints, and end points.
        *   Generate permutations.
        *   Asynchronously call Naver Directions 5 API for each permutation.
        *   Find the optimal route.
        *   Update React state with the optimized order.
    *   Automatic route re-rendering on state changes using `useEffect`.
    *   Improve user experience with loading indicators and error messages.

5.  **Deployment & Sharing:**
    *   Build React application (`npm run build`).
    *   Deploy to Firebase (`firebase deploy`).
    *   Update Naver Cloud Platform with deployed URL.
    *   Push final code to GitHub and update `README.md`.

This plan aligns with the provided `README.md` content and will guide the development process.
